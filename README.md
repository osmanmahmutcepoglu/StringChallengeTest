# StringChallengeTest
Have the function StringChallenge(str) take the str parameter being passed which 
will be two times (each properly formatted with a colon and am or pm) separated by 
a hyphen and return the total number of minutes between the two times.

The time will be in a 12 hour clock format.
For example: if str is 9:00am-10:00am then the output should be 60.
If str is 1:00pm-11:00am the output should be 1320.
